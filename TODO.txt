Allpass

Turn Adder into array adder instead of term1 and term2 adder (other TODOs in Adder.js)

A component that accepts numbers in a method and outputs them in a ConstantGenerator

iOS fallback, if necessary

Array properties

option to make startValue, endValue, baseline constant for linear/exponential generators to prevent recomputations?

A way to specify path references instead of named (so, for example, '../frequency' to get the frequency property of the parent Component)

Make parent, player, registry, tuning into an options object instead of separate arguments?

AudioComponent::connectProperty should be a no-op if the property is already connected
